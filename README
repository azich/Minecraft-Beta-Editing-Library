This repository contains two types of files; libraries and utilities. Libraries provide code common to most or all of the utilities and do not actually perform any function on their own. Utilities perform some basic function and as starting point for creating your own utilities.

Libraries
editor.c - The library for parsing, serializing, and interacting with tags.
bmp.c - A library for reading and writing basic Windows bitmap files.

Utilities
render.c - Make a top-down render of the specified world
depth.c - Make a grayscale depth map of the specified world
drain.c - Replace all water and ice with air for the specified world
dump.c - Print a tree representation of the specified .dat file
hellish.c - Replace ice and water with lava for the specified world
melt.c - Replace ice with water for the specified world
settime.c - Set the time of the specified level.dat
signs.c - Print out the text and location of each sign in the specified world
spawn.c - Set the spawn of the specified level.dat to the player location
warp.c - Change the player location's to the specified coordinates
sweep.c - Remove all entities from the specified world
tnt.c - Replace the specified chunk's blocks with a pattern of TNT, dirt, and redstone
tntish.c - Replace all leaf blocks with TNT for the specified world
trees.c - Melt all snow and ice and Cover all dirt with saplings for the specified world
ladder.c - Create a ladder at the specified coordinates and oritentation
slices.sh - A shell script which uses render.c to make an MRI of the specified world

Using
editor.c has a dependency on zlib for reading the chunks and level.dat

To compile, use: `gcc -lz -o <executable> <source.c>`

All utilities take 1 or more arguments and have a usage if the wrong number of
arguments are specified. So use `./utility` to see how to use it.
